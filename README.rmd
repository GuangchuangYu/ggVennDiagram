# ggVennDiagram

<!-- badges: start -->

'`ggVennDiagram`' enables fancy Venn plot with 2-4 sets and generates publication quality figure. 
It is the first software that can automatically fill different colors to each part of a Venn diagram.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ggVennDiagram from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with (under evaluation in CRAN):

``` r
install.packages("ggVennDiagram")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gaospecial/ggVennDiagram")
```
## Example

`ggVennDiagram` maps the fill color of each region to quantity, allowing us to visually observe the differences between different parts. 

```{r example}
library(ggVennDiagram)
genes <- paste("gene",1:1000,sep="")
set.seed(20190708)
x <- list(A=sample(genes,300),B=sample(genes,525),C=sample(genes,440),D=sample(genes,350))

# four dimension Venn plot
ggVennDiagram(x)

# three dimension Venn plot
ggVennDiagram(x[1:3])

# two dimension Venn plot
ggVennDiagram(x[1:2])
```

`ggVennDiagram` return a `ggplot` object, which can be further modified with `ggplot` functions.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggVennDiagram(x) + scale_fill_gradient(low="blue",high = "red")

ggVennDiagram(x,lty="dashed",color="black",size=2) + scale_fill_gradient(low="white",high = "red")
```

`ggVennDiagram` now support 2-4 dimension Venn plot. The generated figure is generally ready for publish. The main function `ggVennDiagram()` will check how many items in the first parameter and call corresponding function automatically.

The parameter `category.names` is set names. And the parameter `label` can label how many items are included in each parts.

```{r}
ggVennDiagram(x,category.names = c("Stage 1","Stage 2","Stage 3", "Stage4"))

ggVennDiagram(x,category.names = c("Stage 1","Stage 2","Stage 3", "Stage4"), label = NULL)
```

Set `label_alpha = 0` to remove label background

```{r}
ggVennDiagram(x, label_alpha=0)
```

## Showing intersection values

*Note: you need to install the GitHub version to enable these functions.*

We implemented the `get_region_items()` to get intersection values.

```{r}
y <- list(
  A = sample(letters, 8),
  B = sample(letters, 8),
  C = sample(letters, 8),
  D = sample(letters, 8)
)

get_region_items(y)
```

If only several items were included, intersections may also be viewed interactively by `plotly` method (if you have two many items, this is useless).


```{r}

p <- ggVennDiagram(y, show_intersect = TRUE)
p
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
plotly::ggplotly(p)
```

In web browser or RStudio, you will get:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://vnote-1251564393.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/typora-img/intersection.gif")
```



# Venn Diagram for more than four sets

If you have reviewed my codes, you may find it is easy to support Venn Diagram for more than four sets,
as soon as you find a ideal parameter to generate more circles or ellipses in the plot. 
The key point is to let the generated ellipses have exactly one intersection for each combination.

However, Venn Diagram for more than four sets may be meaningless in some conditions, 
as some parts may be omitted in such ellipses. Therefore, it is only useful in specific conditions. 
For example, if the set intersection of all group are extremely large, you may use several
ellipses to draw a "flower" to show that.
