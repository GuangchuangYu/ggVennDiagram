```{r, include = FALSE}

  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(ggVennDiagram)
library(dplyr)
```

## Less dependency

`ggVennDiagram` has a large package dependencies. This is because we build this package standing on the shoulder of those who came before us.

```{r}
dependency = c(
  "sf",
  "ggplot2",
  "dplyr",
  "magrittr",
  "methods",
  "purrr",
  "tibble",
  "plotly",
  "RVenn",
  "yulab.utils"
)
```

Although we only import ten packages in the development, the dependence tree is huge.

```{r}
(deps = pak::pkg_deps_tree("ggVennDiagram"))
```

### Remove sf dependency

Among them, `sf` is the heaviest package that `ggVennDiagram` depend on. 

```{r}
deps %>%
  select(package, sysreqs, filesize) %>%
  arrange(desc(filesize)) %>%
  filter(package %in% dependency)
```



`sf` not only have the largest size of package, but also depends on several system packages, such as `GDAL`, `GEOS`, `PROJ`, and so on. Furthermore, two of the `sf`-dependent packages, `s2` and `units` also have system requirements, especially `units`, whose system dependence `udunits-2` is an additional one that usually not installed by most of the `ggVennDiagram` users.

```{r}
deps_sf = pak::pkg_deps("sf")
deps %>% filter(package %in% deps_sf$package, sysreqs != "") %>% 
  select(package, sysreqs, filesize)
```

However, `sf` is a necessary for the full functions of `ggVennDiagram` in shape generation. So it is difficult to remove it. Therefore, we decided to move the shape generation functions to a new package, namely `shape`. And only import this package as a "suggestion" in new version of `ggVennDiagram`.

### Other dependencies

Besides, several other packages are removed from dependency list after considerations.

```{r}
deps %>%
  select(package, sysreqs, filesize) %>%
  filter(!package %in% pak::pkg_deps("sf")$package, !package %in% pak::pkg_deps("ggplot2")$package) %>% 
  arrange(desc(filesize))
```

|package    |                        reason             |
|--------   | ------------------------------------------|
| `plotly`  | Not the main feature, many dependencies   |
| `RVenn`   | Easy to replace                           |

The author of RVenn agreed to reuse his code and is open for join in the further development of ggVennDiagram. I will also add him as a co-author of the new manuscript.

## More optimizations

### The introduction of `shapeMageR` package

`shapeMageR` is implemented to deal with the shape generation for plotting complex geometries in `ggVennDiagram`. It's named after "shape + mage + R". All the related shape generation functions used in `ggVennDiagram` are transferred to the new `shapeMageR` package. 

- Shape Generation
  - Circle
  - Ellipse
  - Triangle
  - Rectangle
  - Line
  - Dot
- Geometry Processing
  - diff
  - union
  - discern
  - overlap
- Shape Transformation
  - sf2polygon
  - polygon2sf
- Misc
  - shape reading

### Native support for Upset plot

As been stated in our previous publication, Venn Diagram is not suitable for analyzing more than seven sets. In that case we recommend the Upset plot as an alternative method, which is supported by `UpsetR` in R platform. We add native support for Upset plot.

This function will be provided on base of aplot.

### Optimization of default settings

**Transparent background of labels**


**Gray line of region borders**


**Region fill colors pallete**


### Unified coordinations

Transforming coordination.

### Work with TBtools

Provide an official TBtools plugin.
