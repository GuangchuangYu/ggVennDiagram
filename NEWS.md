# ggVennDiagram 1.0

* We completely rebuild `ggVennDiagram` in v1.0. It is now has well-defined data structure and maybe more elegant in coding.
* Although all of the main functions are retained, the usage of a few functions has been modified. This may cause capacitiy issues.
* If you find a bug or have questions, feel free to open a issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/gaospecial/ggVennDiagram/issuess).

# ggVennDiagram 0.5

* Intersection values can be obtained and visualized now. See [README](./README.md) for more information;

* Bug fixings.
